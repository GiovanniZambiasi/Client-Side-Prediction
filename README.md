# Client-Side-Prediction framework
_Made with Mirror for Unity_

This repository contains a garbage free client-side prediction framework, implemented in two different example scenarios:
* CharacterController
* Rigidbodies _*To be completed_

My goal is to develop an easy-to-use, garbage free framework to streamline the implementation of client-side prediction across any scenario that needs it. Though the current solution is still a work-in-progress, it works, and will hopefully avoid the headache of adding all the boilerplate code to all predictive clients your project needs.

## How to use

The developer needs to fulfill 5 steps to implement prediction:

### 1) Implement state

...TBD

### 2) Implement input

...TBD

### 3) Implement the _Messenger_

...TBD

### 4) Implement the _Client_

...TBD

### 5) Implement the _Prediction_

...TBD

== Features
- Error interpolation
- Predictive Rigidbody 
	> Store states in buffer
	> Calculate error when pos comes to determine if prediction update needed
	> If so, re-simulate physics scene (and disable all other RBs in the scene
- Non-local clients ✓
- Host clients? ✓
- Gravity acceleration ✓
- Jumping and (air control ✓)

== Issues
- Players running the simulation under target fps move slower, since they send less input messages/frame ✓

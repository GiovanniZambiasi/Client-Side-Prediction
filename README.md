# Client-Side-Prediction framework
_Made with Mirror for Unity_

This repository contains a garbage free client-side prediction framework, implemented in two different example scenarios:
* a) CharacterController
* b) Rigidbodies

My goal is to develop an easy-to-use, garbage free framework to streamline the creation of client-side prediction across any scenario that needs it. Though the current solution isn't as user friendly as I'd like, it works, and will hopefully avoid the headache of adding all the boilerplate code to all predictive clients your project needs.

## How to use

The developer needs to fulfill 5 steps to implement prediction:

### 1) Implement state

...TBD

### 2) Implement input

...TBD

### 3) Implement the _Messenger_

...TBD

### 4) Implement the _Client_

...TBD

### 5) Implement the _Prediction_

...TBD
